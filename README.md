# Bioinformatics notes

While analyzing various genomics data, I had faced some challenges. I have tried to document these challenges and some other interesting stuff related to Bioinformatics data analysis. The content is grouped into broader topics for efficient browsing. For now I have following broad topics which possibly will change as long as I am doing Bioinformatics analysis. 

## [Utils](00_utils.md)
This page lists some useful utilities I came across.
- [Download all the files and folder from a FTP link using wget](data/utils/01-ftp_wget_whole_dir.md)
- [Configure memory limit for R in linux systems](data/utils/02-R_memory_limit.md)
- [Limit memory for linux processes using ulimit](data/utils/03-memory_limit.md)
- [Easily access reference genome data from YAML config file using `yq`](data/utils/04-yq_yaml_parse.md)
